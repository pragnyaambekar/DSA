'''You are given an array arr[] of non-negative integers. You have to move all the zeros in the array to the right end while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements. The operation must be performed in place, meaning you should not use extra space for another array.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 0, 4, 3, 0, 5, 0]
Output: [1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0]
Explanation: There are three 0s that are moved to the end.
Input: arr[] = [10, 20, 30]
Output: [10, 20, 30]
Explanation: No change in array as there are no 0s.
Input: arr[] = [0, 0]
Output: [0, 0]
Explanation: No change in array as there are all 0s.
Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 105
'''

class Solution:
	def pushZerosToEnd(self, lst):
    	i = 0
    	j = 1
    	while(j<len(lst)):
    	    if(lst[i]==0 and lst[j]!=0):
    	        lst[i],lst[j] = lst[j],lst[i]
    	        i+=1
    	        j+=1
    	    elif lst[i]==0 and lst[j]==0:
    	       j+=1
    	    else:
    	       i+=1
    	       j+=1
        return(lst)
